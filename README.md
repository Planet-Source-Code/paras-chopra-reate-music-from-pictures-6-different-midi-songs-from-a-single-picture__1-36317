### Description

Create music from pictures - 6 different midi songs from a single picture

This code creates music from any picture, although you can implement it to create midi music from files too. You can change the existing picture to any picture of your choice. This can be pretty useful in encryption. But there may be other uses of it also What is technique behind this? This program does nothing but takes a pixel splits it into R, G & B and then uses the facility provided by free OCX "FreeLib" to create midi music. I have zipped that OCX. The value of R, G & B can be Instrument, Volume or Note. Thus creating 6 different types of music. However, the music produced is not much interesting. I coded this when I was bored and I wrote the code. Please give comments, critics and Please VOTE!!!
